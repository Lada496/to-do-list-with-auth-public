This is a simple to-do with an authentication feature. You can save your own to-do list once you sign up.

## Purpose
- Imprementing authentication system with Firebase

## Challenging parts
- Managing data rules in Firebase Realtime Database depending on user authentication status: I wrote an article about Firebase [here](https://dev.to/lada496/to-do-list-with-firebase-web-ver9-hd8)
